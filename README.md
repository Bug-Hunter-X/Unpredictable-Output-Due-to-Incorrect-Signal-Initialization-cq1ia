# Unpredictable Output Due to Incorrect Signal Initialization in VHDL

This repository demonstrates a common VHDL error:  incorrect initialization of signals.  Improper initialization can lead to unpredictable output and difficult-to-debug issues, especially in designs with complex state machines or asynchronous components.

The `bug.vhdl` file contains the faulty code.  The `bugSolution.vhdl` file provides a corrected version.
